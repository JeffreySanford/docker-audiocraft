# FSDP / Offload tips:
# - To enable FSDP or multi-gpu runs, set `distributed_type: 'MULTI_GPU'` and increase `num_processes` accordingly.
# - For single-GPU with CPU offload, leave `distributed_type` as 'NO' and rely on accelerate dispatch with `device_map='auto'` in the script.
# - Make sure the offload folder exists and is mappable as a volume to the container.
