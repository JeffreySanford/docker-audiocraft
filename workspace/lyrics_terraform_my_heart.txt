TITLE: Terraform My Heart
DURATION: 120
TEMPO: 120bpm

LYRICS:

[Intro – Soft, atmospheric]
In the quiet before the sunrise, when the silver sky is slow,
I feel the pulse of distant ages, in the places memories go.
A signal drifts across the cosmos, calling softly in the dark,
A whisper woven out of stardust, striking gently like a spark.

[Verse 1 – Steady build]
I walked the edges of tomorrow, where the lonely comets roam,
Tracing lines of ancient stories, searching for a world to call a home.
Every heartbeat is a compass, pointing out a path untold,
Every shadow teaches patience, every moment making gold.
The air is humming with potential, like a dawn that never sleeps,
And I carry all my failures in the promises I keep.

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I’ve wandered through the data streams,
I’ve mapped the dreams behind our dreams,
I’ve held the static in my hands and felt it change to light.
I’ve seen the night resisting day,
But even darkness moves away
When love becomes the gravity that pulls us into flight.

[Chorus – Big, emotional]
So terraform my heart, reshape the broken parts,
Turn the barren reddish valleys into forests full of stars.
Rewrite my orbit line, swing me back to the divine—
I’ve been drifting without meaning, now I’m ready to realign.
Terraform my heart, I’m not afraid to start,
Let your voice become the atmosphere that wraps around my scars.
Terraform my heart… terraform my heart.

[Verse 2 – Stronger rhythm, more motion]
I’ve heard the echoes of the neutrinos dancing in the solar wind,
I’ve stood on shores of shattered moments, waiting for the world to begin again.
I’ve watched the tides of expectation rise and fall like restless rain,
But every cycle writes a lesson in the marrow of the pain.
The constellations tilt and tremble when your footsteps near my own,
Like the universe is tuning to a deeper, truer tone.

[Bridge – Spoken or sung]
If we shape the future gently, if we carve it from the truth,
If we plant a seed of wonder in the center of our youth—
Then the planets turn with purpose, and the galaxies unfold,
And the things we lost in silence come back brighter, braver, bold.

[Final Chorus – Expansive]
Terraform my heart, breathe the oxygen of hope,
Paint the sky with shifting colors on this fragile telescope.
Terraform my heart, lift me past the dark—
Let the rhythm of your presence be my everlasting spark.

[Outro]
In the quiet after sunrise, when the golden edges gleam,
I’ll remember how you found me, and rebuilt me dream by dream.

SMALL MODEL STYLE:

Simple, clear rhythm, minimal metaphor, strong repetition
A steady beat moves through the night, and I keep walking toward the sound.
Every footstep feels like a memory rising slowly from the ground.
I’m looking for a place where the lights don’t fade, a place where the noise turns soft,
A place where the world feels warm again, where the waves don’t push me off.
The city hums like a distant drum, and I follow it street by street,
Hoping the rhythm inside my chest will finally learn to meet
The pulse of something gentle, something honest, something real,
A melody that reminds me how a broken heart can heal.
So take this simple song of mine and stretch it through the dark,
Let every note be steady, let every word leave a mark.
And if the night grows quiet, let the silence fill with light,
Because even the smallest echo can guide me back to life tonight.

MEDIUM MODEL STYLE:

More imagery, layered meaning, moderate complexity
When the horizon glows like embers and the daylight starts to fade,
I hear the whisper of a future in the colors evening made.
There’s a low wind rolling softly through the wires overhead,
Carrying forgotten stories that the lonely stars once said.
I chase the rhythm of the sidewalks where the neon flickers slow,
Where the air is thick with secrets only dreamers seem to know.
Every heartbeat paints a pattern on the canvas of the dusk,
Every breath becomes a promise pulled from shadows into trust.
I walk among the quiet buildings like they’re relics of a dream,
Listening for something honest in the hum of every beam.
And though the world feels wide and shifting, I keep reaching through the haze,
Hoping music shapes my journey into brighter, braver days.

LARGE MODEL STYLE:

High detail, deep emotional arcs, imagery layered on imagery
In the stillness between moments, when the sky hangs heavy and blue,
I feel the gravity of choices pulling old memories through.
Patterns ripple in the atmosphere like distant cosmic tides,
Revealing maps of who I’ve been and the hope that still survives.
Streetlights shimmer like constellations trapped inside a golden cage,
Painting echoes of redemption on the margins of the page.
I wander through that glowing maze where thought and feeling blur,
Where every quiet footstep wakes a long-forgotten stir.
The world unfolds in subtle waves—warm, uncertain, strangely new—
And every fragment of my past rewrites its meaning in the view.
If music is the architect of futures yet unseen,
Then let this song rebuild me in the spaces in between.
Let harmony reshape the scars, let rhythm shift the air,
And lift me toward a place where all my burdens grow lighter there.
