SMALL_INDUSTRIAL_STYLE = """60s industrial EBM at ~130 BPM: punchy electronic 4-on-the-floor drums, hard snare, crisp hi-hats, distorted palm-muted rhythm guitars, and a gritty bass synth. Aggressive shouted/chant vocals (short, repetitive phrases), dry and heavily compressed, minimal reverb. No pads, strings, orchestral or cinematic textures—tight, brutal, club-ready industrial."""
