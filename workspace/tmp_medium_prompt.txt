A 30 second instrumental industrial rock / EBM section at 160 BPM, extremely hard and aggressive, clearly inspired by early KMFDM backing tracks. Rigid 4-on-the-floor kick (every beat) from a punchy electronic drum machine, with a very hard snare on 2 and 4 and crisp, driving hi-hats. Occasional short tom fills or extra hits are allowed, but the core pattern must stay strict and marching.

Main instruments: distorted rhythm electric guitars, electronic drum machine, and a simple but powerful bass synth or bass guitar. The guitars play tight, palm-muted power-chord riffs in a minor key, chugging eight notes or sixteenths that lock perfectly to the kick drum. No solos, no melodic leads, just brutal rhythm guitar riffs. The bass follows or doubles the guitar riff, with a gritty, mechanical tone that feels like an EBM bass sequence, reinforcing the drive of the drums.

The sound is dry, loud, and heavily compressed, almost brickwalled, like an industrial band playing in a small concrete bunker. Very little reverb, no big spaces, no cinematic ambience. No vocals of any kind. Absolutely no choirs, no organs, no strings, no pads, no piano, no orchestral or ambient textures, no soundscapes, no atmospheric swells. Only drum machine, distorted rhythm guitars, bass, and maybe a few very short metallic synth stabs or noise bursts accenting strong beats. The overall impression should be a fast, brutal, tightly locked KMFDM-style instrumental section that could sit in the middle of a high-intensity industrial rock track.
