10 second instrumental industrial rock / EDM section at 160 BPM, extremely hard and aggressive, clearly inspired by early KMFDM backing tracks. Rigid 4-on-the-floor electronic kick on every beat, very hard snare on 2 and 4, crisp hi-hats. Distorted rhythm guitars playing tight, repetitive power-chord riffs in a minor key, locked to the drums, plus a simple mechanical bassline doubling the riff. Dry, loud, heavily compressed mix, like a drum machine and guitars in a small concrete bunker. No vocals, no choirs, no organs, no strings, no pads, no orchestral or cinematic sounds, no ambient textures, no soundscapes. Only drum machine, distorted rhythm guitars, bass, and maybe one or two very short metallic synth hits.
